# JumpyLlama

This game was the result of multiple months of work for an iOS App Dev class I took. The game is an infinite runner featuring a llama as the main protagonist, although there is an option to change your character. You can also adjust the difficulty of the game which will change how fast the llama moves. The llama must jump over obstacles and avoid pits in the ground.
